Especially when I find that they have Ugali, which is very similar to sadza or mieliepap, that I know from Sub-Saharan Africa.

The waiter that served me could speak English, which saved me from subjecting him to my broken Arabic, and was helpful at pointing out which dishes were vegetable only, and also highlighting which had no ghee (I'm vegan).

I ordered the Ugali with beans and salad. It was delicious comfort food.

I couldn't give them 5, only because he also brought out king fish curry on the tray, which I couldn't eat as a vegan. I recognise he only did this, because he was proud of it, and I wasn't billed for it, so I'm hovering between a 4 and a 5, because the rest of the meal was delicious and exactly what I wanted and needed. In the end, I think of the other restaurants I rated a 5, which were truly exceptional, so I think this one earns a well-deserved 4, for what it is ... A cheap, friendly restaurant and takeaway, with good, comfort food from Africa, Zanzibar and the Gulf.",positive,Solo travel,2022-12-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4713544-d25234055-r873376574-Reviews-Blad_Al_Salaam-Haima_Al_Wusta_Governorate.html?m=66827#review873376574

Some employees are the worst i ever seen in my life like Jeoy .. who is not able to speak politly or even do the minimum requirement ... we requested a small thing .. after he refused i told him that i will checkout because of this silly attitude... he surprised me by telling "" its up to you its not my issue"" the most rude answer i heared from a hotel employee ... some waiters also can't smile in front of us ... 

Some employees trying to recover this horiple restorant like shef Kareem ..  he made some good dishes after we asked him and represented them with his great smile .and Umakanta was polite and welcoming person.

Over all this restorant is in a mess and i couldn't understand their standards of low hospitality and low quality of food compared with any restorant.

Me and My wife are very annoyed because of bad behavior of most of the employees who do not have enough experience and knowledge to work in 5 stars hotel .. if we can call it 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!

We were doubting if we should go because we werent sure about the menu, however nothing to worry about! The food is very nice and there is always something which is to your liking. Prices are relatively high for oman, but it‚Äôs all worth it if you want to enrich your trip.

Arrival:
It is located at Royal Saray Resort managed by Accor but in the newer parts of the resort with a separate entrance. The whole area is not completed so it seems deserted and quite sad in a way as it doesn't give the hip vibes when you arrive like other Bagatelles. Also, they offer valet parking but Bagatelle doesn't validate so you need to pay which is something bizarre in the region and never happened in Bagatelle in Dubai.

Ambience:
Bargetell is famous for its hip, vibrant and colourful ambience but here in Bahrain, yes they have tried but the whole thing didn't feel right and didn't give any positive vibes. The venue was just dark and gloomy.

Food Menu: 
We didn't expect the dishes would be inexpensive but quite pricy comparing other restaurants in the kingdom. We tried 2 starters and 2 mains with 3 sides but they were all ok, nothing spectacular or wow and most of the dishes were delivered lukewarm.
The waitress, interestingly, discouraged us not to choose any cold appetisers by saying that nobody likes this section as most of the dishes are raw (?). It was rather shocking as you won't expect this statement will be advised by a waitress who works in this kind of establishment.

Wine List: 
Not a bad selection but extremely expensive.

Cocktail List:
Reasonably priced comparing other offers.
However, the cocktail we ordered was served in a cheap highball glass, totally underwhelming.

Be ready for a hideous napkin dancing by the waiters, waitresses and chefs.
Seriously they should focus on the product and service quality and ambience, rather than this kinda gimmicky entertainment as if we don't have already enough by OPA.",negative,,2023-02-28T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293997-d24116070-r879165115-Reviews-Bagatelle_Bahrain-Manama.html?m=66827#review879165115

The restaurant has nice traditional ambience and the food is classic meze style - so best to choose a handful of dishes and share them as they arrive. Babaganoush is especially good - really smokey!

We would recommend for a relaxing, unfussy lunch.

Like the restaurant has to decide how much i have to eat! Even I wanted to try other courses despite what i ordered, I did not do so because of this. What a shame, first time happening to me in Qatar. 
When i booked, i mentioned that is a birthday dinner, and they themselves asked and offered to bring a cake, and said yes that you be wonderful. 
Do you thing there was such a thing there?? Not at all.. I wasn't even bothered to ask myself after all of this.

This was perhaps my 3rd visit this year, the most recent one being last Friday. As always, its the amazing service & the incredible people which has attracted me to this bar & made it one of my favorites in the city.

The front desk was welcoming as usual, Pathitta and team with their beaming smiles & friendly demeanour. Next, it was a pleasure to be greeted by my favourite bartenders Biki and Cecille. Cecille knew my usual drink & made sure to prepare that 'Old fashioned' to perfection! Kennedy, who is part of the security team & always a delight to talk to, made sure I had a comfortable seat at the counter in the open space of the bar & updated me on the new changes/offers. 

The weather is changing in Doha & I cannot recommend a better place to enjoy drinks on a weekend, with a fantastic view of the beach & the city skyline. In fact, I've always preferred the outside terrace/balcony area the most, at Manko. 

Looking forward for more amazing winter evenings at Manko. 

In a city with so many bars & clubs, a key distinction for any place, in my opinion, is always the service & the people behind it. And in that category, Manko is second to none, for me.

I had a lovely evening. I didn't tell them it was my birthday as I didn't want a fuss, just a nice meal and a lovely evening.  I got just that!  From the moment I entered, I was warmly greeted.  All staff were super friendly and nice.  Really helpful.  I was served by Farhad and Kate.  They were so nice.  Attentive, yet left me to enjoy my meal.  Farhad was great in helping me choose from the menu.  I ordered a few small dishes including two signature dishes.  This made more sense as a solo diner and gave me the option to try a few different things.  I went with one of the cebiches.  The criollo which comprises the chef‚Äôs fish selection, chicharron calamari, cancha & aji amarillo leche de tigre.  I had the pulpo a la brasa which was grilled octopus with criollo puree, cherry tomatoes with fried garlic and olive aioli.  I also had one empanada (you can choose how many pieces).  To drink I had the chicha morada mocktail.  I could not fault anything.  Beautifully presented.  Each mouthful an explosion of tangy flavours.  Light but tasty.  The octopus melted in your mouth.  The seafood was very fresh.  The cebiche was very refreshing.  The beef empanada added a little spice to the meal.  The mocktail was very nice.  I felt like I was back in Peru.  I loved my birthday meal.  The restaurant is stunning.  Lovely atmosphere.  Hip, sexy and elegant.  I had a lovely table with a view.  A birthday to remember.  Highly recommend!

Not the 5 star experience ive been used to in dubai the 9 years ive been visiting, nor what would be expected at such an establishment. Honestly my first review I've given less than 4 stars. They offered to give us more starters but we just wanted to move onto the mains. We didn't get the desert we picked for some reason (we had selected one which looked unique) and got a basic chocolate plate with browine pieces on it which was nothing special. Food came timely and was good but service was sub-par as the waiters just stand around and aren't attentive. Nothing was set out for my anniversary either and i had stated this on my booking.

I begin by thanking Liezel for setting up a beautiful table for us strewn with rose petals. Next to Mangesh, the man who took care of us whole evening & Abhijeet  in catching up with old Tresind memories. 

Coming to food, in starters, I would recommend trying the burramundi fish. The flavours, the taste n portion would want you asking for more. Even a non fish person like self was hooked. For the main course, we opted for the gold old bengali special of Kosha Mangsho( mutton) along with Peas Kachori. Reminded us of our mom's special. The meal starts with a palette of pani puri, papads & assorted fries & small paratha with buttered. Between meals, palette cleansers are served with lemon & beetroot sorbets. Kind gesture from the team in the form of daulat ka chaat as desserts & birthday treat on
 the house. What a memorable culinary night it was!

The atmosphere was far from enjoyable, with the music being uncomfortably loud, making it difficult to have a conversation. But what made the night truly unbearable was the service. Throughout our meal, no less than eight different staff members repeatedly approached our table, asking if we wanted dessert‚Äîeven after we had clearly declined multiple times. Worse yet, they kept trying to take our plates while we were still eating. This happened over seven times, with us having to insist repeatedly that we were not finished.

Despite being told we had two hours for our table, the staff continuously tried to rush us, making us feel unwelcome. To top it all off, they brought us the check without us asking for it, well before our two hours were up, and while the restaurant was still open. This felt like they were trying to push us out, which was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional.

This was supposed to be an enjoyable evening, but it was ruined by the poor service and lack of consideration from the staff. I insisted on going to Namos, but I regret it deeply.

The menu is quite varied with something for every taste, but we (wisely!) decided to sample from the Omani cuisine page (see my note below about menu layout) and were not disappointed! We ordered three scrumptious dishes to share at our table - Bamiya bil Laham (lamb and okra stew), Saloonat Seafood (simmered in coconut milk/tomato/garlic), Muqalai Lamb (simmered in local spices) and makbus rice (included with first two dishes). If you prefer other international cuisines, they serve those as well.  The restaurant sits with panoramic windows to the sea so you can enjoy beautiful views of the Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. 

A previous reviewer erroneously criticized the menu layout as being backwards. Oman is of course an Arab country and Arabic is read right to left, with books, menus being oriented opposite as well to western language publications. The menu is in both Arabic and English though the rightly layout follows that of the native language. Just a reminder for travelers that the local perspective should be considered when judging such issues.

The team was amazing and was looking after us in details. They remembered us and the items which we want from the 2nd visit. We became part of the place. I can't remember all names but without exceptions all were great ( AlHamdu, Nina, Ali, sorry if i missed the other names)
The food was amazing, the place is fabulous and stunning. The kitchen tean even recognized us. Words cannot describe our feelings but we felt sad that we are leaving. Hopefully we visit Salalah again and then we will stay at Anantara resort.

The standout aspect of our visit was the impeccable service, especially from Ms. Shashin. She was attentive, friendly, and went out of her way to ensure we had an enjoyable dining experience. Her exceptional service truly enhanced our evening.

However, we were somewhat disappointed with the weekend dinner buffet. We had expected a broader selection of dishes, but the options were quite limited. Despite this, the fried rice and noodles prepared by Chef Rocky were outstanding. These dishes were full of flavor and were the highlight of the buffet.

Overall, while the service at Ocean Blue Beach House was exceptional, the variety in the buffet could use some improvement.

My review is based on the one 'downtown', old Salalah on As Salaam St. near Al Qoaf cross street. I ordered vegetable American-style chow mein in the Chinese sectiion. Awful, I didn't even touch it. Presentation counts. They brought out a bowl of rosy-orange semi-transparent glop with shavings of cabbage and carrot, that was it. All topped generously with those long noodly looking croutons. I have eaten several times at the other Al Kutaini, out in Dahariz on Sultan Qaboos road (main road). I'Il assume they offer the same menu - they look identical. Other dishes tend to be on the fiery side. They are best at Indian recipes, especially those that they serve up sizzling on a hot plate. But keep away from ""Chinese"" or any other national dish.

We arrived and saw it was really busy full of local people (a really good start). We were seated in the family area, this meant that my wife and I and our two children were give a cubicle of our very own resembling a hospital A&E room more than a restaurant... Our waiter arrived shortly, and was really helpful in assisting us to make our food choices. My wife and I chose a variety of curries, with tandoori roti - she is vegetarian, however surprisingly there was lots of food options for her too, from daals to vegetables. My children opted for noodles and omelette and chips. Our order arrived, by which time I was ravenous, happy to report the food did not disappoint, it was full of flavour and spice and very authentic. It's like going to your favorite auntie's house and being indulged to the max with traditional home cooked food. We ordered chicken curry, chana daal, and lady-finger curry, & chicken tikka, each dish had its own distinct flavour, very tasty. The restaurant is of Pakistani origins and the cuisine is typical authentic food hailing from Lahore in the  Punjab. The service was great and our waiter could not do enough for us, as we were sat in a cubicle there was a very novel way of calling for additional service - there is a door bell suspended on the wall near the a/c switch! The portion sizes are very substantial, the meal was very reasonably priced. One cautionary word, their menu is vast with an array of other cuisines, my sincerely advice if eating here stick to their specialty Asian food, they cannot cook anything else... frankly my daughter's order of noodles tasted really bland with zero flavour... but why go to a Pakistani restaurant if not to eat Pakistani food!

alTanoor Restaurant is a gem that offers an exceptional dining experience, particularly during breakfast. The variety of food options available in the morning is impressive, catering to all tastes and preferences. From traditional breakfast dishes to more adventurous options, there's something for everyone.

The pastries at alTanoor are truly outstanding. They are some of the best I've ever had‚Äîfresh, flaky, and delicious. Whether you're in the mood for a classic croissant or a more unique pastry, you won't be disappointed.

The service at alTanoor is equally commendable. The staff is friendly, attentive, and always ready to help, making your dining experience even more enjoyable. If you're looking for a place with great food and excellent service, alTanoor is definitely worth a visit.",positive,Family,2024-06-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1940497-d3958283-r955734175-Reviews-Al_Tanoor-Muscat_Muscat_Governorate.html?m=66827#review955734175

First one goes up some stairs, then there is a welcome by a Filipina looking young lady (not always the same), who places one at a table and who also takes the reservations. The waiters were young men, probably from the Indian subcontinent. Generally all the staff were very friendly and professional. The interior decoration is traditional Omani style.

There is a menu card in English and Arabic with an interesting choice of mainly Omani dishes. As appetizers I twice had the 'Gheleambe', a speciality from the Sharqiya region: Watercress salad with shallots and cherry tomatoes in a dried lemon dressing. Fantastic. Another time I went for 'Sahnat Qashe', thus sundried Anchovies with cherry tomatoes and spring onions, put into a form. The very small fish were tasty, but rather tough.

The main courses were always accompanied with rice, either as 'Makbus' (cooked in a vegetable broth) or as 'Qabouli' (in a meat broth). Once I had 'Hammour' (Rockcod), then 'Qabouli Laham' (meat broth rice with pieces of lamb in it) and  'Shuma', the Omani celebration dish with the meat having been cooked for six hours in an underground firepit. Tasty again, but the lamb a bit stringy.

At the end they offered a glass of Frankincense water and local dates. Together with a fresh Mint tea I also ordered once a 'Khabeesa' as dessert, a Date and Cardamom Roux in Saffron and Rose water, served with Vanilla Ice Cream. The next time it was a 'Luqaimat', dumplings soaked in Cardamom, Saffron and Rose Syrup, something I knew as 'Lokma' in Turkey or 'Loukoumades' in Greece.",positive,Solo travel,2023-11-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1940497-d7841569-r958240743-Reviews-Bait_Al_Luban_Omani_Restaurant-Muscat_Muscat_Governorate.html?m=66827#review958240743

This seems to have changed within the last year but that is not communicated. The restaurant is now just on a floating pontoon which you pay 10BD just to sit on. It doesn't move and if it's windy to be honest it makes you feel kind of sea sick. The menu is cheap but the food is not great. Our calamari was so overcooked and the chicken wings were basically just chicken nuggets. The spinach and chicken risotto was good and the v-lounge salad was also good but the price just to sit on a floating pontoon is not worth it. It's a dry restaurant as well which isn't an issue but again the reviews below make it seem like there is wine etc available so that was what we had planned for.

We are die-hard brunch aficionados, frequently planning our travel itineraries to accommodate luxury, free-flow brunches. In theory, this should have been a very good experience; a beautiful venue, nicely set-up buffets and a friendly welcome. In practice, however, there were unfortunately a number of irritants:

- a massive amount of people had been crammed into one space. A number of the tables around us appeared to be children (in their hundreds, it felt) celebrating birthdays. Parents were present but seemed more preoccupied with the cocktails. A free-flow brunch usually evolves or disintegrates (depending on your view) at some point in the afternoon to a very lively affair. In this case, though, it was all a bit too much and way too crowded, loud and busy.

- drinks service was very slow. Our waiter was friendly and obviously did his best, but he only had two hands. Our glasses often went empty. It became a game of ‚Äúspot the waiter, try and grab his attention and hope he remembers to bring you something at some point.‚Äù

- no champagne, only sparkling wine.

- the only cocktail station available served only a couple, anything but innovative, drinks. I asked for a fruity cocktail with vodka (vodka and gin were the two choices available). I was told they could only do a mix with pineapple and orange juice. Boring. At the same time, waiters did serve other cocktails as well, but you had to know to ask for them. In consequence, one table ordered mojitos, and this gradually spread so that everyone in the entire restaurant was ordering mojitos. Then one table ordered another drink, and everyone started ordering that drink.

Overall, the food was good but a Friday brunch is about so much more than just the food.",neutral,Couples,2019-04-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293997-d8280022-r674179213-Reviews-Bahrain_Bay_Kitchen-Manama.html?m=66827#review674179213

I ordered a vegetarian combo. It was pretty much the same as any Ethiopian restaurant with a mixture of potatoes and carrots (tikil gomen), mixed salad, split lentils (miser alecha) and ground chick peas (shiro wat). The shiro was was particularly delicious. Flavorful and just enough spice. There were also some stuffed peppers. I had a little fear about them... I wasn't sure how hot they would be. They were hot... but oh so flavorful. The injera had much more teff that Americans are used to eating, so it was more bitter than I'm used to, but I could really appreciate the authenticity that it gave me.

The restaurant has a bevy of activity. I was there during Ramadan, so there was no alcohol. I have no idea if they serve it, but there is a bar. It seems to be family run and the service was outstanding. Someone always wanted to bring me something, although I had everything I needed.

For an extra treat, hope to be there when they are roasting fresh coffee. A lady was hunched over a small flame next to me roasting (burning) the beans in a small pan. When they were cooked to perfection, she went in the back to grind them, then came back to make coffee in a small traditional pot over the flame. It smelled heavenly. I don't normally drink coffee at night but couldn't pass it up when offered. It was like an earthy chocolate taste. Delectable.

Tango's was recommended to me by an Ethiopian lady that I met. She told me she eats here often, and that was good enough for me. After one visit, I can see why she returns so often.

We used our Entertainer app to order two MILD grilled Chicken Espitada (hanging skewers) with double fries and rice for side dishes. 

When we got our order after a long wait, the French fries were dark, crispy and cold. As soon as they brought it to the table, the manager was nearby and I asked her for a new, fresh order of fries. She stared at me blankly so I asked why they were so dark‚Äîwere they seasoned fries? I think she mumbled yes before walking away. 

My son and I proceeded to eat the chicken, which was very spicy hot. When I asked our waiter if it was mild, he said that ‚Äòmild‚Äô and ‚Äòmedium‚Äô spicy were the same thing. What? I know for a fact that‚Äôs not true since we‚Äôve eaten at Nandos before and it was deliciously prepared with much better service. Our mouths burned but we suffered through only because we were hungry and didn‚Äôt trust sending the food back and having wait another 30 minutes to get our food. 
We repeatedly had to ask for more napkins and finally ordered a soft drink, which the waiter was quick to refill (which was the only good thing about the meal).

Too many employees standing around doing nothing while providing mediocre service and burnt distasteful food. Announcing that we were going to use the entertainer coupon seemed to reduce overall professionalism; even from the manager. Even when we went up to pay, there were four people behind the register confused about how to ring our order up using the coupon. Very Disappointing and exasperating. 

Overall, the food and service tonight was totally unsatisfactory. We will be very hesitant to return to Nando‚Äôs at this location. They should hold their managers to a higher standard and train their many employees how to properly cook, prepare, and serve the food as well as how to effectively treat and communicate with their customers.

We have always been a fan of their dishes. Started from the famous Durrat Maki, Smoke Lava, and Hokkaido to trying out their other menu as well! Teppanyaki/Teriyaki grills are great. It was tender and well cooked. SALAD! Oh don't get me started with the salad. If you are on a salad diet, you definitely need to try their Crab Volcano Salad. When it comes to appetizers, there are also different delicious options. You have dynamite shrimp popcorn, edamame, and a special favorite of ours is the seafood soup. BUT if it is your first time, I would recommend going straight to their Kojo Specials first. There will be a high chance that you will be reviewing the restaurant like me as well!

Let's go to Atmosphere, shall we? Kojo interiors have that countryside Japan feeling. The lights are dim, there are private rooms and you will really feel the inspiration from traditional Japanese culture. I would suggest browsing their website since the images of the food and their outlets are posted there! Comfy and cozy and a great place for an intimate gathering with friends and family.

Service is superb! They really have great team/staff though the restaurant has a tendency to have busy hours. But still, I think that is similar to all the restaurants. They will assist you on your order. They were actually the ones recommended the food items to try and we thank them for that!

All in all, go to Kojo and try the specials menu. If you are already a fan of sushi, the taste can be described as modernized with a lot of flavors in it. If you are a first time Japanese cuisine customer, trust me, you are missing out on a lot of great food!",positive,,2021-07-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293997-d8601268-r813375996-Reviews-Kojo_Japanese_Restaurant_Juffair-Manama.html?m=66827#review813375996

I visited Al Abraaj Adliya Branch, today on the 24th of June 2023. 
After a hectic day at work, around 2, I headed over for lunch to the restaurant, ordered food and was waiting for it to arrive when suddenly a huge cockroach landed on my table half unconscious. 
My entire day was ruined within minutes. We headed back home all frustrated with the experience and didn‚Äôt feel like eating anything for the rest of the day. 
Pathetic experience, will never recommend anyone to visit the restaurant and furthermore will take this matter to the management tomorrow as they are closed today. 
Until then choose wisely! Food hygiene and safety should be our topmost priority while choosing a place to dine in.

The salmon was softly cooked and the sauce was the best due to balance in flavor. The spinach was softly cooked and easily chewable. I love couscous; it is a great alternative to rice. It is super healthy and light.  My drink was the Iced peach tea.  You will prepare your tea. It is a casual tea ceremony! The Peach tea is mixed with orange juice and Lemon slices. You will have to add Liquid sweetener to balance the flavor for yourself.  I love dark chocolate. I have to try this bitter flavor, everywhere. I had Dark chocolate cake with salted caramel biscuit. It was a large portion. It was not too sweet. I had the remaining cake for takeaway. I unpacked the cake at home it was turned upside down. The best part of the melted chocolate was scattered around the container. A great Fast WIFI is available for uploading.  It takes seconds for a complete upload.

It is PoQe Bowl; it is smoked salmon with arugula, one boiled egg, grilled artichoke in oil, cherry tomatoes, and avocadoes sprinkled with black sesame seeds.  You‚Äôve a choice of 2 dressings: lemon vinaigrette or soy dressing. By the way, their classic cheesecake and orange loaf are moist & delicious. I never hesitate to try a new dish, because I know that I will get a tasty main. My drink is always the beetroot and orange juice. The PoQe Bowl is simple and healthy.  This Hawaiian dish has been around for centuries. It‚Äôs basically Hawaii‚Äôs favorite food and for good reason: PoQe is healthy and simple.

We are still enjoying the Coconut Curry for years now. The quantity of this main is perfect for 1 person. The flavour comes enriched with lemongrass and ginger.  The Tomato Caper Pasta is another favourite of ours. It is a light and savoury dish with black olives. This main is full of flavour and incredibly simple to enjoy. By the way, we love the Mom‚Äôs cake as well. We will order the cake next time.

They have a wide variety of traditional dishes and it was all pretty good. I think the issue here would be price/quality, but as I didn¬¥t pay I can¬¥t say too much. I suspect it¬¥s pretty reasonable value. The only comment I would make is that the restaurant itself is fairly uninspiring with bland interior and cafeteria style layout. That said I would have no problem going back for lunch if I am in the area - I just won¬¥t be making a point of it.

The ice cream was creamy. The quality of the pie had not changed. I had it years ago, and it is still the best. I think my last visit was 2017. I will surely go back to try the brownie with chocolate sauce.

After reaching home, three of them noted to be sick and stomach upset due to the extra spice.

We had a great welcome , but not the right way of approaching. I asked him what is seasonal fruit but he is responding me i will give it to you complimentary. Who are you to offer me complimentary when i come to take a dining experience and giving me whole fruit in the table like a fruit basket. 

After he kept the bottle on the table of water where  i served my self.

I order for 2 blackbery mojito . Disgusting black berry syrup in mojito without a lime flavor in that presentation was disgusting , felt like a small kids did a trail mocktail. 

Then he place desser which we dint like or consume it might be we dint like the taste . 

Service was dam casual carrying the glass in the both hand and he is serving in our table . 

Even the waiter were carrying the tray but now this old guys in blazer outdoor were doing rubbish service . 

I asked for bill and he presented the bill he dint even ask how was the food and why u guys have not consumed it .

Moral of the story is 

Find young and energetic employees with positive mind set for the place to get the market value . 

At last 9 KWD was the bill i paid him 15 KWD . 

That was not a tips i paid for the complimentary fruit basket which provided in the table in a rude manner which cost 3 kwd  . 
 
And rest 3 kwd is for you to recharge your phone some internet pack and watch some guest satisfaction in restaurants vidio and gain some knowledge. 

Treat every human same . Doent matter we come in blazer or shirt . White or black . Dessert or lunch .

.
I ordered the beyond meat wrap and I received the ciabatta (mistake No 1)! Obviously, I found out about ‚Äúthis mistake‚Äù once I am back home. I called staff and requested a replacement; I drove back to the store and was greeted by the store manager and Varish (Nepali), the barista who prepared my order.  I returned the ciabatta and received the wrap.  Varish remained silent and seemed agitated. 
.
I ordered the NEW caramel mousse and it was out of stock. On my 1st arrival for pick up, I was informed and was given the choice of another item. I choose water. I paid (1,320 KD) for the vegan mousse, and I got one water bottle (600 fils) instead of 2, to compensate for the price. Varish was present and he remained silent. By the way, I found out about the price discrepancy (mistake No 2), once I am back home scrutinising the invoice. I could NOT go back, for the 2nd time, to collect the remaining water bottle. 
.
On the next day, I discovered ‚Äúmistake No 3‚Äù, by which I ordered the Perrier Peach but received Perrier Strawberry. At this point, I think it is about time to clear this messy issue & deliberate move of Vinesh to discourage NEW customers from coming again. I called the manager (Mr. Arthur), and requested to receive the missing water bottle and the Perrier Peach today; once and for all. I had to visit the store on the 13th of March, and to my surprise Mr. Arthur offered me the newly stocked Vegan Chocolate Caramel Mousse as a BONUS and I got my Perrier Peach as well. 
.
My conclusion, is that Vinesh, the barista, is either careless or is directing his anger towards customers. The whole Starbucks experience was a waste of my time and it was a big hassle going to complete my order, by visiting 3 times in two days.

If you like to venture out a bit, and have a hankering of ribs, I would recommend this place.
My wife had the Classic Sirloin with Grilled Avocado steak, my son had a normal pasta, daughter Quesadilla Explosion chicken salad, while I had the full-rack BBQ Beef Ribs. The portions were big, with the steak cooked to my wife's liking - medium rare. The salad and the pasta were ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, according to my two teens, so nothing to shout about. 
My full-rack, however, was the biggest I have had so far in KSA ‚Äì as I mentioned before, I was on a quest to try all the ribs from all the popular chains in KSA. Just as Chilli‚Äôs described it, the full rack was moist and falling off the bone, with a nice smoky BBQ tastes which was not too sweet and not too savoury. It was not the best tasting of ribs I had, but definitely the biggest and was good enough for me. 
I have not tried Chilli‚Äôs ribs at its other branches ‚Äì there is one in Jubail where I am based ‚Äì so I hope the quality is the same.
One thing that would have made our dining experience even better if Chilli‚Äôs had offered a pitcher of the cocktails, but I guess you may prefer individual choices. A bottom-less soda would be great as well.

My visit to ""Al Baik"" in Madinah was far from what I expected. The order process at the cashier was chaotic and noisy, making it difficult to communicate. I ordered two Shrimp Sandwiches without being informed of the additional wait time they required. The process of collecting the order was disorganized, with customers pushing aggressively to give their receipts to the staff. I experienced a significant delay with my order, ticket number 190 from 20.12.2023, while orders like number 211 were served before me. The workers' shouting and machine noise made the 20-minute wait, which is lengthy for fast food, even more challenging. Meanwhile, the taxi I had waiting added to the urgency, as the taximeter was running.

The quality and size of the Shrimp Sandwich were even more disappointing. The sandwich was tiny, barely 1.5 bites, and for the price of 21 SAR (about 5 euros), I expected more, especially considering that in Switzerland, I could get a larger, better sandwich from a cleaner store for the same amount.

Additionally, I was surprised to learn from my credit card statement that Al Baik is part of Carrefour.

For sure my face is familiar to most of the waiting staff there (well anyway, maybe) and I feel sad that amongst the review I wrote for this establishment this is the lowest rate I've given. 

Even though the supervisor and the staffs are apologetic to what happened, I feel that it's worth mentioning to raise some awareness also in behalf of all other customers.

Here's what happened - so me and my friend were eating buffet with hotpot, so while in just half of the hotpot we go get our drinks and to our surprise when we get back to our table it was cleared already. Most of the time, we always taken vegetables and meats for the hotpot twice so imagine this is just the first one and we're just half way down eating. It's really, really bad experience. And take note, this is not the first time it happen. The first one, since it's first so you just somewhat let it pass. So now for sure, you understand why I need to make a review about it. Though they've been apologetic about it. But I guess somebody should do something about it to prevent it from happening again.

Most of the restaurants in the OS are located along the beach, called Sea Side.  We had a look at the various venues and menus and settled on Barahat because we are fans of Indian cuisine.  Our experience was outstanding. 

We sat outside on the terrace.  It was a little cool this time of year, but pleasant.  They don't have outside heaters or blankets.  The latter would be a good idea to have on hand.  The service was excellent -- the waitress was knowledgable and able to explain everything we asked about, very polite and attentive, and always eager to help with any need.  We ordered the butter chicken and the prawn tikka masala curries, along with garlic naan bread and raita.  They served poppadams with a dipping sauce as complementary items.  They also gave us a taste of a new item for the drink menu, a kind of lassi or shake made with pomegranate.  Very good.  

In fact, every dish was outstanding.  The shrimp and chicken were tender and properly cooked, the gravies were thick and masterfully spiced, and the naan bread was among the best we have had in Doha.  We often find it is too dry in many restaurants.  Here it was buttery and had just the right amount of garlic.  The raita was also thick and luxurious, very refreshing due to the grated cucumber.  I asked for additional spices because my wife prefers milder food.  The waitress brought me three condiments -- a bottle of hot sauce, Kashimiri chilli powder, and a third that featured cracked black pepper and something else I could not identify.  All good and a nice spectrum of heat options. We had lemon-mint drinks with our meal.  

One of the owners (we think) stopped by our table near the end of the meal to thank us for our patronage and ask about our experience.  He was very nice and informed us that they are developing new dishes and to please return to try them.  We certainly will!

The total for our bill was 142 QAR.  A good deal for a great meal.",positive,,2020-03-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3221436-d8526065-r749437287-Reviews-Barahat_Al_Wakra-Al_Wakrah.html?m=66827#review749437287

I definitely got that, with excellent food, that looked good, tasted good, felt good

But I got even more, with a truly beautiful restaurant, that made me really feel like I was traveling to Greece

And also a very friendly staff

I enjoyed it so much that I ordered more than I usually do, having pumpkin soup (goat cheese, coriander oil, sourdough bread), Greek salad (tomato, cucumber, feta mousse, onion, green peppers, capers, olive oil, oregano), spanakopita (home made filo pastry, spinach, feta mouse, dill oil), risotto (shrimps, pumpkin, white truffle oil)... what a feast!

OmG! That is why I told her to check first right?

I did a lot of research looking for a restaurant that we wouldn't be able to find at home and I saw many great reviews for Bandar Aden.  We walked over from our hotel and found it easily via Google Maps and some well placed signs.  It was 95F at 8pm and the a/c felt great as we entered the restaurant.  It wasn't full when we arrived but got increasingly busy as the night wore on and by 9:30pm there was a line waiting for tables.  You have the option of sitting at a table or in in a carpeted room on the floor with cushions.

We weren't familiar with Yemeni cuisine so our waiter gave us his recommendations and shared a menu that had photos of the popular dishes.  We started with a clear broth soup and 4 of us shared platters of Lamb Mandi, Chicken Buried and a pot of beef with tomato, served with fresh hot bread.  The lamb and chicken dishes came with seasoned rice.  It was all wonderful but the lamb stole the show.  We had never had lamb so tender!  The beef and chicken dishes were also delicious.  We stayed at our table for nearly 2 hours trying to finish because it was so good! 

The Corniche is 5 minutes away and I recommend taking a walk over after dinner.  The views are beautiful and the walk after a heavy meal felt great.

So, after that and also because there was only a table of two who were drinking and shisha smoking, not eating, we didn't expect much. However, the seafood was quite amazingly good. A wide variety, cooked to a T and crispy batter on the calamari and fish. Also, not having ever tasted ceviche (Peruvian marinated raw fish) and not knowing what it was, we were all completely hooked. At 110 dhs and enough for two people, we thought it good value.

We had lunch with our family and enjoyed their tasty kebabs and overall good service. Menu is comprised mostly of Persian cuisine, but they have also european food in their menu. 
It is also one of the most popular places for tourists and locals. One can choose to eat in a common hall or have a separate place with curtains to close. Overall it is a calm and welcoming place. 
Food was prepared and brought quite fast and all our ordered meals were huge. So it was quite enough to order three meals for five people and share them among us. It was also quite pleasant to have complimentary soups and vegetable salads with ordered meals from the restaurant - a practice which I have also encountered in some other restaurants in UAE. What I did not like in Sadaf is their lack of friendliness with even simple technologies. They provide clients printed menus with few pictures of meals and simultaneously bring ipads to show pictures of other meals, desserts, etc. However, they have no even prices attached to the pictures, so you have to look them again in printed menu for the prices, or ask waiter when you suddenly find out that those aren‚Äôt in menu at all‚Ä¶ Our main waiter seemed little enthusiastic in advising us not only about meals, but also about complimentary soups and salads, so we ordered and then cancelled same salads‚Ä¶ same waiter in turn was quite fast to check the tips we had left when leaving‚Ä¶
Luckily, we were not served by that single waiter only, and we had much better communication with other waiters serving us‚Ä¶ So I believe, a little more training will be better for some personnel and updating ipad photos with prices and descriptions would be of much better convenience for foreign clients.
By the way, the first floor of Sadaf has a small store that offers Persian sweets, dates, nuts and other tasty food to take with you.

The Happy Farm restaurant is a Korean based menu where your table has a pot of soup imbedded in it and you can flavour it with either seafood or meats. Also on the table is a BBQ plate for grilling your food. For a price of 69aed you can eat and drink as much as you like. Warning you will be charged for any left food on your plate. Good policy. Just take what you need. The food and soft drink are delicious and plentiful as is the service. What a great find.

This restaurant is not part of the all inclusive package. However we decided to dine here on the Surf & Turf night, 
We were given a menu, that we thought you had to choose your starter, main and dessert, however that was not the case.

You are shown the menu, and you get all the food on that menu! 

The portion sizes were huge, so you do need a break between each course.
The starters were mixed ;
selection of cheeses, with a jam/preserve in a cute basket
smoked hazelnuts & black grapes
farro bowl, selection of meats, 
crispy onion rings
burrata, pulled beef
green tomatoes muruglia olive oil
spinach , dried cranberries, pistou, roasted vegetables
turkey ham, chicken pinxto

Mains ;
Angus Beef ribeye
angus striploin
beef back ribs
corn fed chicken
braised lamb leg
sea bream
red snapper
prawns
salmon
with mixed veg, mashed potatoes lemon butter sauce
mushroom sauce

And if you have room for pudding after all that..( we didnt...)
Molten Chocolate cake
mango cheesecake
banoffie pie
fruit platter

All of this including wine, beer was 260 AED ( ¬£53 per person)

Absolutely beautiful food, and great service. 
The Manageress Archie, was so caring and thoughtful, such a beautiful lady with a very kind heart, congratulations on your promotion, so well deserved.

They serve Vegetarian, Meat, and Seafood dishes with the addition of Iranian, Asian, Italian varieties as their buffet is priced at AED 50 in Ajman & Sharjah but for Dubai, it's AED 70 which is reasonable as per their wide variety of dishes.

I have been to this place in Ramadan but this time we went for dinner and it was a great experience as their attentive customer service is outstanding.

For those who love food and buffets, Daniel Restaurant offers you an abundance of international and Iranian dishes, but it specializes in Iranian food, and in its desserts, the food is delicious and fresh, and the behavior of the staff is sweet, beautiful, and sophisticated. However, I hope they will introduce us to discount services such as Esaad Fazaa or Hamat al-Watan, and for all those who want to order in homes, chalets, or tents, they will offer this to you. The service is even with chairs and tables, but the price depends on the people and what the food is, unless you order it, I advise you to try it and enjoy what is delicious.",positive,Family,2023-01-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298060-d8742787-r921336113-Reviews-Danial_Restaurant-Ajman_Emirate_of_Ajman.html?m=66827#review921336113

There was an intoxicated customer at the bar table who loudly swearing and staggering around. I might expect expect to see this in a local bar but not in an establishment advertising for families.

Upon requesting the waiters moved us to a table closer to the restroom, which was unpleasantly stinky. All of this made us decide to leave even before settling down properly. The manager, Mr. Gunter, showed little interest in understanding our situation and discomfort as a family.

Bite Board

Drums of Heaven [AED 28]: The chicken lollipops tasted delicious. Perfect crunchy exterior which we love. We got about 9 pieces in one box which is quite a lot. If you need that extra tang you can dip it into some soy sauce and have it as well.

Crispy Beef [AED 40]: The crispy beef was cooked a little over well done for us. It was too hard and the flavour overall was overwhelmingly sweet which wasn‚Äôt something we expected nor liked. Giving this a pass.

Chicken Fried Rice [AED 26]: This tasted good. The fried rice was flavorsome with a mix of a generous amount of egg and chicken pieces which we appreciated. The quantity was well enough to serve 2 to 3.

Chicken Manchurian [AED 36]: This is our staple order when we get Chinese food and though the consistency was slightly on the watery end than we would have liked, the flavours were all there. Again generous chunks of chicken and paired well with the fried rice.

Chicken Hakka Noodles [AED 32]: The noodles tasted delicious with a considerable portion size as well. Again for that extra tang, we added some soy sauce to it to bring it all together.

Mongolian Beef [AED 40]: This one is known to be on the sweeter side so we were expecting it to be a little sweet and it was. However the beef pieces were cooked well and weren‚Äôt tough and we liked the sauce used here as well.

Overall, they are worth a shot and currently have some good deals going on which will make the food quite reasonable and allow you to support local business as well.",neutral,,2020-04-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298064-d3921802-r752891406-Reviews-Chin_Chin_Al_Majaz-Sharjah_Emirate_of_Sharjah.html?m=66827#review752891406

Though the presentation of the Wontons Basket was amazing , taste wise I would give a 10/10 to Potato Chilli dry. Where the Wonton Baskets had a pretty average taste, Potato Chilli dry was hero of the starters.¬† A very unique taste for Potatoes in Chinese style ( a must try ).

For main course we had Veg Manchurian & Thai Red curry . I was impressed by the size of the Manchurian balls which were quite big compared to the usual ones we see . The taste was pretty average but the portion could easily suffice two person. Thai Red curry was a winner , both in taste & presentation. One of the best Thai Curry I had till date ( a must try ).

Veg fried rice & Schezwan noodles were the ending dishes of our meal. Both were equally tasty & had the authentic taste. Schezwan noodles could be called a complete meal in itself & can be savored solo.

The food was very clean along with value for money portions. Overall would definitely go back to this place for Thai Curry , Schezwan Noodles &¬† Potato Chilli

Firstly, the prices for such food are simply high. For such a small sandwich it cost about 60 dirhams, which I think is a lot since the sandwich is super small. At Subway, a large sandwich costs about 45 dirhams. Also the presentation looks very bad, because when waiter put a plate to my tables some of potato wedges almost fallen down from the plate. We can say that the Subway cannot compare with this restaurant in terms of service, but I never received serviced service at Nando‚Äôs. The waiters had upset faces and at the end they asked me if I could leave a tip. Dear restaurant, this question from the waiters puts the guest in a very awkward position, because it is almost like begging. If the guest liked the service and food, he will leave a tip without question. The only thing I liked was that the milkshake which was delicious. I might come here again for the drinks, but not the food.",neutral,Solo travel,2023-10-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294013-d11714537-r923981465-Reviews-Nando_s-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html?m=66827#review923981465

We explained that as we had our small but often noisy parrot with us it was better to sit on outer tables and not potentially annoy other guests, as we have done on several occasions previously!  Unfortunately he wasn't having any of it. Apparently if ""we sat there others might try to as well"" - bizarre! 
Not a big issue but frankly ridiculous, wonder if the owners know he is turning away business - and the parrot is a great attraction usually for the many kids there, she loves the attention. And normally the staff are so good with her and us. 
Disappointing certainly having driven across town specifically to go there but plenty of other places to take our money these days, and closer to home!

 The menu looks fantastic and the premises and location looks great too‚Ä¶ However this place has not moved on, from its glory days, when it was new and fresh..there are slight maintenance issues, wear and tear and cleanliness needed.

There should never be any broken or chip furniture insight of customers, especially if it could cause safety issues. There are 
areas that need to be addressed, such as the balcony.. so much more could be done.. rather, it is lifeless. The exterior balcony design is flat, it‚Äôs cold and not very welcoming‚Ä¶ has no view appeal.. Furniture need variation, a little warmth.. some plants, pottery, matts, lights or candles, soft seating etc..

Management needs to be a bit assertive and run a great team, providing a great team spirit and harmony to showcase your assets‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Service & Food‚Äù

The menu, like I said looked great, but the food I ordered was disappointing, it was bland lifeless once again. Food should always look alive and fresh!‚Äô 
The food menu for some dishes should describe exactly what is being served. I ordered a Shrimp burger slider meal and what I got was a flat patty with chopped up chives or whatever it was.. I was expecting a tasty juicy crunch biting into a shrimp with my patty??? But no.. if only they did!!! It would have made all the difference and I would have been prepared to pay extra dollars for that value and experience‚Ä¶ 

All in all, the location and sight made up for the short comings of the food experience‚Ä¶ but restauranteurs!‚Äô Never rely on location or view or background of your restaurant to bring in the clientele.. Food, Food, and Great Service..

I must make special mention of our waiter John! He was delightful and very professional. His mannerisms and personality was very charming and attentive‚Ä¶ He will be an assert to your restaurant given the time and investment.

We reached around 1.45PM - we did not have any reservations, but we were seated promptly.

Our order was Murgh RelAla kebab, galawti kabab, bharwan paneer tikka, Buuna Murgh, murgh Malai kabab bIryani, - with lasooni naan, masala papad, rocket anar rait and lassi

The rezala kabab was our server's recommendation. While a bit spicy, it was an excellent dish 10/10.

The gawlati kakab, as my favourite, was perfectly made 10/10

The paneer tikka, a tad bit dry, but still very well made - 8/10

The bhuna murgh, also another server's recommendation, was the star of the lunch. Perfectly spiced, not too much, and soft tender chicken with the garlic naan really hit the spot - 10/10

Lastly, the malai tikka biryani, will always be a personal favourite, although the others at the table could've wanted a spicer biryani. Maybe next time, but for now 10/10

We also added in a masala papad and Amar raita, both of which were great accompaniments.

We decided to forego dessert this time. 

Also, here I would like to mention our server LAXMAN, who kept good pace with the serving, getting our orders customized, and was attentive to our table all evening in spite of the busy lunchcrowd.

I also realized later that I could have availed of a Fazza discount, but was not asked. It's not an issue, but would have availed of a 30% discount.

Great service (with a smile), food arrived promptly and was very tasty and plentiful, and priced reasonably.  For the following evening's special, I took advantage of the 'unlimited wine and cheeseboard' offer.  What a disappointment... a huge disappointment.  
The selection of cheeses I got on the cheeseboard was pathetic, especially considering that JTG has an impressive array for sale.  As I recall, a slice of cheddar, a slice of brie, some smokey cheddar, cut into small cubes, and a Wensleydale Cranberry Cheese, essentially on the cheaper end of the cheeses they'd normally sell individually.  This was garnished with a few grapes, dried apricots and walnuts.  The waiters were surly, entirely uninterested and I felt as though I was imposing.  My first glass of wine took a good 10 minutes to arrive, and the cheeseboard (bear in mind that the only preparation is to cut some cheese and add a few crackers) took another 10 minutes to arrive, there were three waiters working a total of 6 tables, essentially 14 guests, so they weren't rushed.   The Shiraz I had was mediocre but palatable, so that sufficed, but again, the second glass took so long in coming I'd practically given up.  Unfortunately the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) and the disappointment was made worse by the expectations of service the previous night had promised.  Totally not worth the price for this ""experience"".  Save up, buy the cheeses you'd like to try and make your own cheeseboard or charcuterie at home with a good bottle of wine, it'll be better value for money, and the service will be far more cosy!",neutral,Business,2024-05-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294013-d15549482-r956643402-Reviews-Jones_The_Grocer_Khalidiyah-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html?m=66827#review956643402

The menu is a complete mix of food styles from Mexican to Japanese to sea food etc. so the name appears to only be connected to the fish tank inside the restaurant. The atmosphere was confusing too, the place looks like a smarter style restaurant as opposed to the sports bar across the path, yet the music was too loud and too base heavy for anyone hoping to have a normal conversation with their fellow diners. 

Our experience was mixed too, General quality was good, fish and sushi were fresh and tasty, ceviche was odd, mash potato was awful. 

Finally our experience with the service was very disappointing. While all interactions were very friendly and helpful, trying to get service was almost impossible. We had to constantly go looking for a waiter/ress to get service, get cutlery after food was delivered without it, ask for extra drinks, ask for condiments that were not on the table etc. 

So all in the place had decent food and good value but could be sooo much better with some attention to service standards and a clearly defined identity on product and ambiance.",neutral,Family,2023-04-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294013-d5443815-r887769073-Reviews-Aquarium_Restaurant_Yas_Marina-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html?m=66827#review887769073

The waiters removed our wine once, and I stopped them as the glasses had wine left. Then I went to play with my little daughter and when I was back my parents were pissed and all our wine glasses disappeared.
I asked to speak with someone who is Italian. It took me a while as they tried to let me speak with everyone else (although they were promising me to speak with someone who speaks Italian multiple times).
Then, the only Italian speaking waiter came to me. He is nice and off course would have never endorsed something like this.

When asked by our waitress my husband informed her that the meal was horrible and pushed it aside after two bites of it. She then proceeded to take away the plate.

We arrived shortly after 8 am. We were the only guests. The ratio of visible staff (4) to guests (3) was 1.333 to 1. 

We went for the ‚ÄúAnything you order‚Äù for me and the kids. I ordered one English Breakfast l, a half haloumi bagel and a half tuna bagel. These duly arrived an incredible 30+ minutes later. The half bagels were OK. The English breakfast was iffy. The omelette was woefully overcooked, the bacon was > 50% fat.

At 8:50, I ordered a slice of cake and 2 small pancakes for the kids (desert) and a spicy omelette (Bombay). The cake and pancakes arrived 10 mins later and were good. 45 minutes and 2 reminders later, there was no sign of the Omelette. I asked for the bill, paid the full price and left, nearly 2 hours after we arrived. My final bill of AED 164. This covered a small (kids size) plate of substandard English Breakfast, 2 ok-ish half bagels of haloumi and tuna mix, 2 small (kid‚Äôs portion) pancakes and a slice of rainbow cake. On a relative basis, this is arguably more expensive than the highest end restaurant in Abu Dhabi.

I made my feelings clear to the overstaffed crew. I might as well have spoken to the walls. No apology, no refund gesture, nothing!  

By a long way, this was the worst dining experience I have ever had. A few years back, I had a similar experience at the same place. I  could excuse the old experience because the place was busy and the staff were apologetic and rectified the matter. None of that this time round!

However, I feel compelled to express my concern regarding a recurring issue we've experienced, wherein the manager appears to show preferential treatment towards Indian customers.

On two separate occasions, my family and I were denied seating on the couch, being informed that it was reserved for larger groups. Nevertheless, we couldn't help but notice that the same couch was later assigned to two Indian ladies. This biased treatment by the manager, Sunny, is deeply troubling and reflects negatively on the restaurant's reputation.

Despite this setback, I must commend the outstanding service provided by Tina, a gracious Filipina who consistently greets us warmly whenever we dine at the restaurant. Additionally, Jessie, a hardworking Filipino staff member, tirelessly accommodates every customer's request, even when visibly fatigued.

I sincerely hope that this review receives the attention of the management, urging them to reconsider their policy of seating customers based on their ethnicity. Fairness dictates that tables should be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, regardless of one's background.

What I attacked first was the salad section that had a great selection of fresh and pickled veggies that I paired with fresh feta cheese, with some greens and Arabic pita bread.

I moved onto having a clear soup and some rice paired with Chinese gravy, that was decent.  I sampled some Mac n cheese with a side of spinach & corn too, it was delicious.

In the Indian selection, there was idly Sambar, chutneys and some pongal that was not too spicy, almost like a Kichidi, perfect for kids.

There was a good variety and standard on quality & service.  The coffee was top notch, the sausage were great, the omelettes could have been a bit fluffier, they were mostly flat

Mang Inasal is a fast-food chain notorious for its bestseller, inasal na manok, which is available in two parts: paa or pecho. Covered with spices and grilled over a pit, the chicken inasal can serve as a satisfying viand even without the complementary condiments or sawsawan (soy sauce with calamansi & chili üå∂ ).

This was our first touchdown with hotpot and it was superhit. 
The restaurant is very typically chinese starting from the outside to inside. All the internal decor with high dark open ceilings to abundance of chinese lanterns of different sizes and artforms with nice nooks and corners- a delightful place.
The staffs are a class apart- remembering Mr. Rehan, Mr. Ali, Ms. Chang here- all of them when we may need something and how to guide us.
They do have ala karte options too whih might suit many diners.
The menus were very colourful and with pictures depicting the items- which is of great help.
The Hotpot comes in Spicy, Basic bland and a mix of both -versions, we took the mix where the pot has two distinct separate sections of spicy and bland versions. After having both the versions- I preferred the bland simple side more. 
You can put 42 types of raw fresh food of veg and nonveg varieties in ready to cook slices , in the pot and cook for roughly 15 mins- when it gets ready. After that you can continue putting items as per your choices and this can go on with unlimited quantity. There can be a small restriction though- if it's busy, the time limit is 2 hrs and also please don't take anything you can't eat- basically don't waste. 
So plan your meal beforehand, if possible. 
There are around 6 types of barbecue grills in this package which includes fish and chicken among others. Also 4 types of desserts- chinese sweets , and a soft drink. The sweets included sesame balls and potato balls with purple yum stuffing. I have heard about the golden buns but it was not to my liking.
The total of this unbelievable and humongous menu is only 49 dhs per person. It's an earth' shattering price and we recommend it absolutely.
Theare some combinations of raw spices which can be put in with mixtures of different quantities to produce a most delectable sauce. This sauce is to be added to the cooked items and savoured to your heart's content. 
Our most favourite items were Crabs, Crab balls, Australian lamb, Chicken fillets, Kankong greens, Fish tofu and so on. We took second helpings of the crab balls and BBQ chicken wings too. They also had at least 3 types of Mushrooms, squid, crab sticks etc.
Authentic cutleries added to the traditional values and experience. 
I had a Plum drink from china, which was separate from the soft drinks and it was at 8 dhs for a large bottle. 
The walls are full of praises and heartfelt outpourings of love from very satisfied customers and we too duly added our notes of appreciation to the wall arts as well as to the staff columns. 
We were really touched by the personalised services and very helpful attitude with smiles from all the staffs. 
We wish all the best for their success and future endeavours. ",positive,Friends getaway,2020-11-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d19121505-r777929630-Reviews-Seven_Hotpot_Restaurant_Al_Rigga_Branch-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html?m=66827#review777929630

They currently have a happy hour promotion for beverages between 3-6 pm where they give you 40% off the beverages. (However, they refused to give me my discount !!!). I even wrote to the manager who could be least bothered. She said ""she raised the complaint internally and address all issues I had raised"". No apologies whatsoever, no compensation for having over-paid despite the promotion !!

This is what had happened.  I visited with a friend at 5pm and we first ordered some juices (quite pricey at normal pricing) and also ordered small starters and salads. These were ok and nothing to write home about. There are way better places in Dubai for food & drinks. 

We then ordered another round of juices at around 6pm. Following that we ordered coffees at around 7.30pm.

The service was EXTREMELY and painfully slow. It took us almost 30 mins to get the bill and that too after summoning the waitress and finally going up to the counter.

They are under-staffed. Initially, for COVID, they had reduced the seating area, but when we went recently, they increased the seating area, yet there was only one waitress running around so you can't  really blame her.

When we called the bill, Happy Hour discount was not applied. When we asked why, they said because we called the bill at 8pm and happy hour is till 7 is what they told us.

I told them you should have informed us so that we could have closed that bill and got the discounts at least for the 4 earlier beverages and then we could start a new tab. They said the waitress was supposed to inform us but she forgot !!

Great ! Their mistake, we suffer and pay way more.

There was NO apology from the staff or the manager and they could not care less.

Needless to say, I won't be giving them my business any more. 

My recommendation is, Go to other GREAT coffee shops in Dubai where the service and standards are way better and the staff care about their customers.",negative,,2020-08-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d8541969-r768621139-Reviews-The_Coffee_Club_Wasl_Vita_Mall-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html?m=66827#review768621139

This is what made me sit down here. The tables, of metal with an oval shape and a high edge all around, are not too comfortable for eating, but the location with seating partly under a portico, partly under tents or then just by the creek, is attractive.

Going there twice for dinner I was first served by a friendly young lady, probably a Filipina, while on the second evening an Arab type woman with a Hijab was in charge, who was hardly paying any attention to her customers. For payment an Indian looking man showed up.

My choices for dinner were once a Machboos, a popular dish in several Gulf countries. It is well spiced rice, that could be had at this restaurant with chicken, beef, shrimps or - the most expensive - with hamour. Under that name go various fish here, usually a kind of grouper. I went for the fish variety. It was nicely served with a plate cover and it was a very big portion, which I could not finish. It tasted very good though.

On my second evening I went for Fareed (more often known as 'Thareed'), a very typical Emirati dish, consisting of Regag flat bread covered with Chicken Saloona, thus a stew in a tomato based broth with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetables like carrots and eggplants. I didn't particularly like this dish with the soggy bread and an overall rather strange taste of the here yellow coloured Saloona.",positive,Solo travel,2023-03-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d25425529-r885140168-Reviews-Khaimat_Jumeirah_Kitchen_Al_Seef_Branch-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html?m=66827#review885140168

I have been a loyal customer of The Black Smith restaurant in the hotel for quite some time, and while most of the staff members are absolutely amazing and always go above and beyond to fulfill my requests, my experience with Chef Rafi has been nothing short of a disaster.

From the moment I made a special request, it was clear that Rafi was completely dismotivated and uninterested in accommodating my needs. His attitude was appalling‚Äîhe seemed down, frustrated, and made me feel like a burden for simply asking for something a little different. Each time I‚Äôve interacted with him, he‚Äôs been dismissive and unprofessional, and it‚Äôs become increasingly clear that he has no passion for his job. His constant complaining and negative demeanor have left me feeling incredibly disappointed.

It‚Äôs unfortunate because the rest of the staff at The Black Smith are wonderful, but my encounters with Rafi have soured my entire experience. His lack of enthusiasm and poor attitude have made me dread visiting the restaurant, and I‚Äôve even started hating the place because of him.

We ordered Schz noodles and hot and sour soup with spring rolls
The hot and sour soup was served in a disposable container and was served within 2 minutes. Not sure if it was already ready in the kitchen but was surprised with the serice speed.
It didn‚Äôt taste as quiet good as compared to many other restaurants we have tried out. It gave more of an Indian hot and sour flavour rather than an authentic one. Not worth the taste
Next were the spring rolls which were again not very different to any other restaurant. If you going for it, please note it is nothing different than a regular one
Veg Schz Noodles- This dish compared to other two was better in taste. The quanity was lot no doubt in that, but the taste again was not up to the mark. Being a popular chineese restaurant, I was not satisified with the taste over here

‚ú®Teas (Left to Right) - Classic Pearl Milk Tea & Choco tea with pearls toppings ‚ú®From - Sharetea, Burjuman Metro Station Exit 3, Dubai
‚ú®Prices -
Classic Pearl Milk Tea : {Medium = AED 17 and Large = AED 20 }
Choco tea : { Medium = 19 and Large = 22}
Additional AED 3 for toppings of choice ‚ú®Rating - 8/10 .
.
‚ú®Located right at the metro station makes it's a very popular place for metro travellers.
They have a quaint and cozy seating space on it's 1st floor which is great for an official or personal meeting.
.
.
An additional tip would be to go there before 9-9:30 PM as post those hours, the tapioca pearls get soggy and aren't as fresh as the ones available at the start of the day. Overall, it's s fulfilling experience for all bubble tea lovers! .
.
‚ú®Fun Fact - Bubble tea can be consumed with a huge variety of toppings such as Tapioca pearls, Popping boba or even jelly.

Food, brunch is a bit deceiving, it‚Äôs more of a set menu that you select a main course.
The waiters brought the starters to the table, for 10 of us, sliders were good, Tacos ok‚Ä¶salad was limp lettuce with some sort of dressing, not that appealing.
We had to wait around 30 minutes for our mains.
My fillet steak arrived, looked good, the small pot of pepper sauce (I think it was pepper sauce, but tasteless) was cold.
The fillet steak should have been medium rare, it was more well done.
Waiters had disappeared!
Two small portions of overcooked thick cut fries arrived to be shared between 10, two small bowls of mac & cheese, two bowls of greens beans, there were around 10 in the bowl for sharing.
Just not enough accompaniments.
We had to ask for more.
Problem, they didn‚Äôt turn up!
Service was far too slow, overcooked food, insufficient amount of food.
Desserts‚Ä¶carrot cake, cheesecake & one other‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt look very appetising.
I didn‚Äôt have any, friends did appear to enjoy the carrot cake as they ordered a second helping.
The waiters did follow up on asking if we wanted drinks though‚Ä¶
Entertainment‚Ä¶not to my liking really. Main problem was the noise. It was far too loud, we really couldn‚Äôt hear each other talk. Constantly shouting at each other. Not enjoyable.
I got so frustrated I checked the noise level & recorded levels, at times, over 100Db.
Over an hour later my ears are still ringing.
Not an enjoyable brunch at all.
Now, the last annoying part, most hotels in Dubai have valet parking which ends up free if you are spending moneys at the bar or restaurant.
The Rixos uses the JBR Green Parking‚Ä¶there‚Äôs an extra 100AED to pay for!",negative,Friends getaway,2024-08-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d13226070-r965282204-Reviews-STK_Dubai_JBR_The_Walk-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html?m=66827#review965282204

Sadly, the quality of the food has gone downhill significantly since then. It‚Äôs not really a brunch as you get a bunch of lacklustre starters and desserts foisted on you, with the free will to choose only the main course.

That said, it depends what you want from this as a night out. If you want to party, it‚Äôs phenomenal. If you want to speak to your partner/friends or whatever, then don‚Äôt bother. We noticed a couple of unsuspecting tourists sit down, not be able to hear themselves think and promptly leave before water even arrived‚Ä¶

But for a party brunch, it‚Äôs exactly what you want. There were at least 3 groups of glamorous ladies that were clearly paid to be there and get everyone up and moving. As soon as the dessert spoons went down, the DJ dropped a certain tune and BOOM, up they all got onto the tables and started encouraging everyone to join in. 

It‚Äôs a shame the ‚Äúfun‚Äù is manufactured and it leads me into a deep pit of despair to think that this is what we‚Äôve come to as a society, but‚Ä¶. It WAS fun once they got everyone up and about.

This was our second visit to Dubai Marina, and it was just as amazing as the first. The staff continued to be exceptional, and the rooms were still great. However, we were a bit spoiled during our initial stay when we were graciously upgraded to a suite.

On this occasion, we found the club room wasn't operational, which was a disappointment. Nevertheless, the hotel compensated by offering complimentary drinks in the bar, a gesture we appreciated.

The biggest downside of our return was the pool situation. It seems the pool area has been franchised out, resulting in loud music and overcrowding with non-residents. This detracted from the tranquil atmosphere we enjoyed during our previous stay, and sadly, it's a reason we wouldn't consider returning.

Overall, while our experience was still positive, the changes to the pool area significantly impacted our enjoyment of the hotel.",positive,Couples,2023-04-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d10188650-r940849166-Reviews-The_Address_Dubai_Marina-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html?m=66827#review940849166

I went for a Foie gras, perfectly served which was sheer poetry.
As a main course I tried a very popular dish : a filled pastry with rice. Never had the opportunity to enjoy such a masterpiece including the well prepared rice.

Todays tour of Dubai with tourists friends was even better. Having experienced the worst kind of service in Dubai during our morning leg, the Arabian Teahouse made up for it 100 fold. 

Food as usual was delicious and served in no time. Mainstays for me are the lamb saloona, mix grill, hummus and moutalbal. My visitors are always blown away by how good the food is.

First time back to this branch in 2 years and the renovations was amazing. 

Attentivness of Mohammed our attendant impeccable, even offering a blanket to one of my guests as he immediately picked up she was a liitle cold (in the middle of summer üòÖ but the AC in my opinon was a welcoming solace from the scortching summer heat)

Love the new loyalty app.
